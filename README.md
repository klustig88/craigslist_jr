Craigslist Jr.:

A simple implementation of a Craigslist clone.  

The layout of the application is:

1.  A page that lists all of the categories (Homepage)
2.  A page that lists all of the postings of a Category
3.  A page that lets someone create a new posting in a given category
4.  A page that lets someone who has created a page return to edit/update the page

There is no user authentication through the website, instead when a user creates a new post, they are given a "secret"
randomly generated URL that allows the user to edit their post.
